				<h1 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mbr-white mb-4 display-1"><strong>Policy</strong></h1>
				
				<p class="mbr-fonts-style mbr-text mbr-white mb-4 display-7">This practice aims to encourage patients to develop a positive relationship with their doctor and practice staff over time to enhance the provision of high quality comprehensive patient care including effective health promotion and strategies for the early detection of disease.
<br>
<br>This practice has strategies and policies that encourage continuity of comprehensive care by facilitating:
<br>• Relational continuity between patients and their doctors
<br>• Management continuity by various people involved in the patients care
<br>• Informational continuity across health care events.
<br>Over 25% of our active patient health records have entries extending back over two years.
<br>
<br>Procedure
<br>Informational continuity
<br>General practitioners, nurses and allied health workers co ordinate the management of individual patient care within the practice.
<br>• Doctors, nurses and allied health workers involved in the care of patients within the practice have access to the patient’s health record.
<br>• Clinical care administered is documented in the patient health records by the health professional administering the care.
<br>• Plans for the management of patients with complex clinical conditions are documented in the patient health record to ensure consistent clinical care and advice is provided to the patient.
<br>• To ensure clinical care is consistent with the best available evidence, culturally sensitive and consistent throughout the practice, Doctors, nurses and allied health professionals regularly attend clinical meetings or staff in-service together.
<br>• Health summaries are updated to reflect recent significant events as information is gathered by staff providing clinical care, so that care remains responsive to patient needs.
<br>• Issues raised in consultations are documented in the patient health record to enable other doctors, nurses or allied health workers providing subsequent clinical care to follow up previous problems.
<br>
<br>Therapeutic continuity
<br>Our appointment schedule allows for patients to develop an ongoing relationship with the practice staff, Doctors, nurses and allied heath worker of their choice.
<br>• The appointment system has a separate appointment list for each general practitioner.
<br>• Patients are able to request their preferred General practitioner when making an appointment and this request is accommodated if possible. This also applies to practice nurses or allied health professionals that are part of the practice team.
<br>• Where possible “walk ins” are also able to see the general Practitioner of their choice, if requested.
<br>
<br>Continuity of care
<br>This practice implements strategies to encourage patients to continue to attend the practice over time.
<br>• Patients are enrolled in diseased prevention and health promotion activities where eligible and receive reminders for health checks.
<br>• A home visits and after hours service is available.
<br>• Children receiving immunizations are recorded on the practice immunization reminder schedule and notified when future vaccinations are due.
<br>• Where preventative activities such as Pap screening or immunization are provided the patient is bulk billed.
<br>
<br>Doctors in this Practice are free to make decisions that affect the management of their patients in accordance with accepted clinical practice.
<br>
<br>• Doctors exercise full autonomy in determining:
<br>
<br>• The health professionals including specialists, other general practitioners and para-medical practitioners to whom they refer.
<br>• The pathology ordered and the company that processes the request.
<br>• What other diagnostic services are ordered and where.
<br>• What type and frequency of follow up appointments are made for patients and the scheduling of such appointment.
<br>• Whether to accept new patients provided that this action is non-discriminatory and does not apply to emergencies.
<br>
<br>GPs and clinical staff of our practice are consulted prior to the scheduling of appointments and the purchase of new equipment and supplies. This Practice seeks feedback from doctors and other staff concerning the use of this equipment via clinical and staff meetings and informally.
<br>
<br>Non English Speaking Background Patients
<br>
<br>
<br>We provide a health service for a diverse multicultural population. The practice identifies the cultural background of its patients, particularly those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status to assist with disease prevention and delivering culturally appropriate care. Patients who do not speak English or who are more proficient in another language, have the choice of utilising the Interpreter Service or a translator who may be a family member or a friend. A member of our staff may also be available to act as translator.
<br>
<br>Our Doctors and staff have a professional obligation to ensure they understand our patients and that the patients understand any instructions or information.
<br>
<br>Please note that, whilst some of our staff are bilingual, not all are accredited interpreters and should not be used as such, unless the patient has consented.
<br>
<br>A member of the patient’s family, especially a child may not be a suitable translator and should not be encouraged.
<br>
<br>Wherever possible the Translating and Interpreter Service is used for a more appropriate interpreter.
<br>
<br>A list of translator and interpreter services is maintained and readily available to staff.
<br>
<br>Procedure
<br>
<br>Once you have determined that the patient may need an interpreter eg. via telephone booking or at the start of the consultation, ask the patient if they would like the use of an interpreter.
<br>
<br>Check the patient’s medical record to see if an interpreter has been used before.
<br>
<br>The patient may consider that a family member or friend could interpret at the consultation. If so, note this on the cover of the medical records for the doctor to see.
<br>
<br>An appropriate staff member can act as interpreter if the patient consents.
<br>Contact the staff member, who will act as translator, to book them. Confirm this with the patient.
<br>
<br>If an external interpreter service is required please refer to the list of interpreter services located at the front reception desk and in the doctors consulting rooms and Treatment room. As this list is updated annually please check the date to ensure you are using the latest version.
<br>
<br>If the TIS is the chosen option, ring Doctor Priority Line Tel: 1300 131 450 (free service) or fax (02) 6264 3753 to book an interpreter. This service is available via telephone at the time of consultation or if appropriate advance notice is given (usually 48 hours), the interpreter can be on site at the practice during a consultation. It is also available for home health assessments if booked by the Doctor. TIS is available 24 hours a day. For further information see our brochure in the library located in the staff room or e-mail TIS on tis.enquiry.line@immi.gov.au/tis<br><br>It is our strict policy that child immunization can only be given if the Immunization Book is presented.<br><br><strong>Privacy and Security of Personal Health Information policy
